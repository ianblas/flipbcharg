# **BCH Circular Economy: Adoption #250, B2B and salaries in BCH.**

We have achieved the promised objective of [**100 merchants**](https://map.bitcoin.com/), and now continue striving for more.
We at [**Bitcoin Cash Argentina**](https://bitcoincashargentina.com/) believe that the variables that promote the growth of this currency are many, and they mutually enhance each other.  
For this reason, and whilst we highlight its use by businesses because it is quantifiable, we would however like to invite you to **read the following document** carefully, so that you may better appreciate the value that we are adding, geared on consolidating what we have already achieved and promoting the different use cases.

## Diversity
We firmly believe that one of the key factors leading to general acceptance of this currency, is to be able to count with a wide range of types of businesses in which consumers might be interested. For this reason, we ae doing a differentiated and diversified work to reach the **greatest number of business options** in our communities.
Today, there are **more than 40 different items** making up our map of merchants and businesses.
 
<p align="center"><img width="800px" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6RPK4BXIAY8UJu?format=jpg"  /></p>
 
**Growth of the Community** (Supplementary Variables)
Wallet Activation: We give small quantities of BCH to more than **250 persons every month**, so that they can have their first experience in using p2p electronic cash.

Our community includes with **more than 200 active persons.**

**Business-to-Business:** We work together with shops and businesses in order to ensure that their own **suppliers will also accept BCH**. In this way, we help to promote a **circular economy using Bitcoin Cash**.

## Support: 
Merchants and businesses (i.e., employees, owners, and clients), as well as people in general with doubts or problems to solve, count with our **24/7 technical support** through our [WhatsApp-based service](https://wa.me/5491164883409/).


## The arrival of major chains and B2B:
### K24
One of the major successes in the actual use of BCH in Argentina, was the incorporation of **K24 (Convenience Stores chain)**, which to date has 30 active sales points and the possibility of introducing BCH throughout its entire network of **84 sales points**. Each of these shops requires **extensive employee training** work. In this way, we ensure that any person in Argentina’s Capital City (Buenos Aires) can buy a wide assortment of **daily-use consumer products** using BCH.

## Suppliers:
Thanks to the strong link built with the owners of the K24 chain, we were able to **access their suppliers**, which opened the **way for B2B using Bitcoin Cash in Argentina**.

## Salaries:
This business chain intends to use revenues generated through **BCH to pay all their 300 employees’ salaries**, either fully or partially.

## Remittances:
The **300 employees** of the chain are for the **most part immigrants from Venezuela.** This opens the opportunity for us of generating a **monthly flow of remittances** from hundreds of immigrants living in Buenos Aires who need to send money to their families abroad.  The good experience that these persons have with BCH would be shared by them with other immigrants, and this could trigger a **boom in BCH remittances**, thus promoting the direct use of the currencie in their countries of origin.

## Another B2B example:
One of our merchants is in the **restaurant business**: Shawarma Al Amir.
Another one of our merchants is in the **butchery business**: Carnicería Agustín.
We thus detected that there was an **opportunity of linking** them both together so they could formalize sale-and-purchase operations between them, thus also **promoting B2B**.

## [The BCH Experience:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjTpMRQu5Nk)
- Two in-person Meet-ups were held:
- “Che Bonche” Beer Hall & Bar in the City of Buenos Aires.
- The third Meet-up will be held during the **inauguration of a new shop** (French Crepes BA), which is in the China Town tourist area of the City of Buenos Aires.
- In these two gatherings, **more than 200 persons** used BCH.

## Seminaries:
Seminaries for businesses and users focus on basic Bitcoin Cash training, together with promoting the experience of using this currency. All invited participants downloaded a wallet and made at least a couple of transactions. In the case of merchants, our objective is that they implement BCH in their own businesses.
At the same time, we have given talks together with **educational institutions**, in order to promote more and greater knowledge of BCH in other specific **communities**.

## Training for Shops:
Every time a new shop or business starts accepting BCH in Argentina, this is accompanied by an **educational effort**. This comprehensive training (owners, employees, and consumers) allows the actual use of the currency to grow.

## Virtual Meet-ups:
The generalized mandatory confinement and “social distancing” makes all these interactions more complex in the local BCH community.  However, we work together based on the use of **group calls and videoconferences**.

## Lotteries:  
Initiatives that are calling the attention of a different public are lotteries and raffles.  We make direct BCH lotteries, or directed to consumption with specific merchants using the BCH that were won, via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bitcoincashargentina/)

## Copa América - [Football](https://www.instagram.com/p/CREt-6sL9EN/)
We accompanied with our presence all the America Cup Football matches in which Argentina played, and in the final match for the world cup, and gave out BCH prizes to persons who guessed the right results.  There was a total of **7 lotteries**, each of which had an **average of 200 participants and 200 Likes**.  

### Various Gifts:
**4 lotteries** were held that gave away payment coupons to be used with our merchants. This helped to **promote consumption** in shops accepting BCH


## [Audit:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CQq3eMksuQF/)
- Each audit implies educational and training work, amongst shop owners as well as employees.
- We supply them with stickers, QR code frames, merchandising, etc.
- We audited **70 physical shops** and businesses (in-person).
- We audited **30 digital shops** and businesses.

## More tools on our Website:
- Now, [Prompt Cash](https://bitcoincashargentina.com/#servicios) is part of our recommended services.

## STAGE #4: “100/250 ACCEPTANCE & USE, B2B, REMITTANCES”
Implementation Period: **180 days.** (We will endeavour to reach this number as quickly as possible, however we feel more accountable by accepting a commitment to a specific deadline date).

## UPGRADED WEB – [**NEW SEARCH ENGINE**](https://bitcoincashargentina.com/directorio/)
We were able to identify that the best way to target consumers is through a better search tool.  For this reason, we are working on incorporating into our website a new search engine that simplifies directing clients to the merchants that accept BCH in Argentina.
This [**directory**](https://bitcoincashargentina.com/directorio/) allows the user to easily find **location, category, tags, geographical proximity, name, products**, etc. Our objective is that users may have a **frictionless experience** when searching and **choosing a merchant** that accepts BCH in Argentina.

## Together with merchants, we support the use of Bitcoin Cash:
After several meetings with [**Libros Libertarios**](https://libroslibertarios.com.ar/), we reached an agreement whereby Bitcoin Cash Argentina can **reach more people**.
We will send all clients who purchase books, a brochure with a full guide and a QR allowing them to claim Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
- Sending BCH to people purchasing books allows us to know that those receiving them are 100% real persons residing in Argentine (and also allows us to know how many of these people cash-in those funds).
- The same website where they purchase books allows them to pay in BCH.
- This website has more than **31,000 followers** in [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/libroslibertarios/) , and sells hundreds of books each month.
