Bitcoin Cash Argentina has performed a key role in promoting BCH and expanding the BCH ecosystem in Argentina.  We have implemented comprehensive strategies that span auditing shops and stores, monthly meetings and gatherings, and management of digital communities. In addition, we led and planned such key events as the “BCH Argentina Conference - October 2024". These initiatives have consolidated a robust and expanding user base.
Our last Flipstarter Campaign was carried out 18 months ago, and reflects a solid level of self-sufficiency, allowing a constant flow of activities and tangible results during this period.  In spite of the various drops in the price of BCH, we have nevertheless exceeded all of the objectives that had been set for this proposal, thus showing our resilience and determination.
This new stage therefore builds on the value of what has been achieved to date, and reinforces our mission of continuing to drive the growth and consolidation of Bitcoin Cash in Argentina and throughout our entire region.

## What we shall be doing:
#### Bitcoin Cash Argentina Club:
We will be launching the Bitcoin Cash Argentina Club (or BCH Argentina Club).
A unique and exclusive area designed to strengthen our community and promote networking. This proposal includes weekly meetings at a fixed location, with the option of participating on a virtual basis, allowing greater flexibility and global scope. Every week, there will be different activities: games, educational chats, project presentations or interviews with key national and international community figures and players
The club will keep a carefully planned events calendar that ensures an enriching experience for all members throughout a whole year. Club membership will be made available with payment solely in Bitcoin Cash and will be open to people from any country, thus ensuring access to all club activities and benefits. This will be a closed and selective group environment that has been planned for people wanting to connect, learn and contribute to strengthening the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.
 
#### 5 new lotteries:
We generally carry out this type of competitions with products and services from the shops and stores that are already members. Afterwards, winners are guided to acquire products in shops and stores accepting BCH. This allows us to quickly increase the number of real BCH Argentina followers on social networks (especially Instagram). Post

#### Implementation:
1. 6 new BCH Experience.
2. Shops and stores auditing.
3. Maintenance of active shops.
4. Filtering of shops that are not active.
5. 50 news shops and stores (our objective is to each 400 shops).

#### Influencers:
Take a look at the case of [Lilia Lemoine](https://x.com/lilialemoine). Our purpose when working together with influencers on social networks such as Instagram, X and Facebook, was to take advantage of their reach, which acts like a "bullhorn" making Bitcoin Cash (BCH) better known to the public, and also to increase the online audience of BCH Argentina. Unfortunately however, in Argentina there have been many cases of influencers who misled many people into Ponzi schemes.  Our objective is to help people distinguish BCH based on its unique features and characteristics, and to highlight the advantages of using it in Argentina.  
For example: 
1. [Case 1](https://x.com/lilialemoine/status/1637861563561304092)  (+45.7k views).  
2. [Case 2](https://x.com/lilialemoine/status/164198235032508416) (+12.5k views).

#### Apps maintenance and update:
We will apply resources specifically to the maintenance of CAJA caja.bcharg.com, which is a platform that allows shops and stores to integrate BCH into their systems, and MAPA (mapa.bcharg.com), which is an improved version of the map of stores and shops in Argentina. Our approach will be focused on solving issues, dealing with bugs, and ensuring an optimum operation of both tools.

#### Community Bot:
We have a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) sales and purchases group dealing in Argentine Pesos on WhatsApp, which is used intensively by the Community.  In order to improve safety and mutual trust amongst participants, we plan on developing a karma bot that will help us assess the reputation of users based on their interactions and transactions inside the group.

#### A new USAR:  
(usar.bcharg.com) is a platform allowing the sale and purchase of products directly using Bitcoin Cash (BCH), without middlemen or custodians. We will be redesigning this website in order to optimize operations and reduce its maintenance costs. We will be incorporating the use of United States Dollars (USD) as a currency, together with Argentine Pesos. Additionally, we will be using resources to guarantee maintenance of the site over the next two years, ensuring its continued stability, growth and evolution.
