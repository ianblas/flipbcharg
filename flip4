# Flipstarter IV
We are proud to inform that we have achieved and surpassed the objectives that we had set forth in the Flipstarter dated Oct 3, 2022.
During the previous Flipstarter, given the market situation at that time, we made the decision to divide our goals into two parts: some for Flipstarter 3 (previous) and others for this Flipstarter 4. In addition, we have made adjustments in some of the goals that we include in this new Flipstarter. In this opportunity, we have selected the 9 actions that, according to our criteria, can generate a greater impact, in order to moderate the request for resources from the community. As always, however, we leave open the possibility that anyone interested can contribute outside of this Flipstarter to advance with the rest of the initiatives.
Regardless of the outcome of this Flipstarter, our dedication to promoting the widespread adoption of Bitcoin Cash remains unwavering. Rest assured that our services (community manager, 24/7 support via whatsapp, business promotion, business monitoring, etc) will continue to be provided with full commitment.

# Goals of this Flipstarter:

## Adoption: 50 new shops and stores for Argentina. 

We understand that utilization and adoption are interconnected and crucial for the successful establishment of Bitcoin Cash. Our goal is to expand the acceptance of BCH in Argentina, aiming to reach a milestone of 350 stores that accept it. By increasing the number and diversity of businesses accepting BCH, we will provide the local community with a wider range of options to make purchases.
Objective: 350 sales points


## BCH Experience:  
We will organize five (5) new meetups where businesses that have integrated BCH will attract new clients, and community participants will receive guidance and support in utilizing BCH for purchasing products and services at these stores.

## Branding Merchandising:[**See full KIT**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VWN7K9w9_tHQeClLDH_dHKTHfnHJaW8/view?usp=sharing)
On this occasion, we want to carry out the production of Merchandising Kits.
We have noticed that both shop employees and the shops themselves can play a crucial role in creating an impact on individuals who are not yet familiar with BCH. That's why we have engaged the services of industrial designers to collaborate with us in defining every aspect of the items that we believe will achieve the desired effect. We will be producing Merchandising Kits (please refer to the attached pictures) that will be distributed to member shops and stores.

Objective: 
To generate a positive brand image among users who are still unaware of BCH. 
Foster product loyalty among owners and employees. 
Enhance the relationship between employees and the tool we are offering, as it will facilitate easy access and practical usage.

## FootGolf Agreement: 
Monthly passes to raffle and give away for 6 months. 
Payments with Bitcoin Cash. 
Loyalty of the FootGolf Argentina community. 
Mutual support of both communities.

In this agreement, we commit to offer monthly passes to be raffled. These passes will be valid for a period of six months, allowing the lucky winners to enjoy this exciting sport on a regular basis. Bitcoin Cash is already accepted as a payment method for FootGolf related services.
This agreement is primarily aimed at promoting positive synergies and establishing a strong connection between both the FootGolf and Bitcoin Cash communities. By bringing these two worlds together, we believe we can foster mutual growth and fruitful collaboration.

## Educational Videos
The purpose of these videos is to offer high-quality content in Spanish. In the second phase, they will be provided to "Influencers" recruited by BCH Argentina. This way, we will give the product significant market visibility. 
"Convert your Cryptos to BCH": What are the compelling reasons to switch my BTC or other cryptocurrencies to BCH? How can I proceed with the conversion? In Argentina, many people hold cryptocurrencies, but only BCH is widely accepted as a payment method. One of the main objectives of these educational videos is to encourage people with other cryptocurrencies to join the BCH community. 
"Buying and Selling BCH": Promotion of different methods for direct purchase of BCH using Argentine pesos (and viceversa) in a custody-free P2P environment. 
"How can a User accept BCH?": This series of videos is specifically designed to educate individuals who own or work in shops or stores (both online and physical) with the aim of implementing the best platforms for accepting BCH as a form of payment.

## Tutorial Video:
This is a different way of highlighting Bitcoin Cash’s effectiveness and efficiency compared to other forms of money. The protagonists of this video are four friends who plan to travel together. Each of them uses a different payment method: 
Marcelo: Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
Juan: Bitcoin (BTC) 
Alberto: Argentine Pesos (cash) 
Cristina: Bank Transfer 
The objective of this video is to identify and describe the obstacles, tax retentions, security concerns, and other issues associated with other payment methods, while highlighting the numerous advantages of Bitcoin Cash in all aspects. We will not shy away from addressing the complexities of today's high level of price volatility. 
To bring this video to life, we will be recruiting an animator to create the necessary animations.

## Influencers
Take a look at the case of [**Lilia Lemoine**](https://twitter.com/lilialemoine) 
The objective for utilizing influencers (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook) as a "megaphone" for BCH is to expand the reach of BCH Argentina to a larger online audience in the crypto Argentina communities. Unfortunately, in Argentina, there are numerous instances of fraud where influencers mislead people into participating in Ponzi schemes. Our goal is to help people differentiate BCH by its qualities and highlight the advantages of using it as a transaction medium in Argentina. For instance:
[**Example 1**](https://twitter.com/lilialemoine/status/1637861563561304092) (+45k views). 
[**Example 2**](https://twitter.com/lilialemoine/status/1641982350325084161) (+11.4K views).

## Sponsorship “A” – Similar to the “Argentina Open FootGolf”
In 2021, we proudly sponsored the "Argentina FootGolf Open," where we stood alongside prestigious brands like Hyundai. This highly regarded international tournament ranks among the top six in the world for this sport, attracting 200 players from Argentina and around the globe. Looking ahead to 2023, our intention is to continue our tradition of sponsoring significant annual global events. We aspire to once again support a prominent world event that showcases the best talent and fosters the growth of FootGolf.

## Mobile App
We believe that this will revolutionize the use of Bitcoin Cash. 
This app will pave the way for us to send notifications to each user. This way, we will be able to integrate into each person's daily routine to encourage the use of BCH. One of the challenges with having numerous shops is that clients may not be aware of their existence. While many of us rely on map.bitcoin.com to discover nearby options, we may overlook shops that are not in close proximity but offer delivery services or online sales. That's why we aim to develop an app that brings shops closer to users. As a result, shops can promote their products with BCH discounts, and users will have a hub that displays discounts when using BCH. 
Additionally, this app will provide a flexible and direct way for new individuals to join the network of stores and shops.
